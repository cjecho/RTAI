	prompt "Inlining mode of user-space services"
	help
	Allows choosing among:
	- Never inline:         i.e. user-space services are linked to 
	  programs against the appropriate support library (e.g. liblxrt.a 
	  for user space RTAI syscall services).
	- Eager inlining:       i.e. static inline, always inline regardless 
	  of compiler's optimization switch;

config RTAI_FPU_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable FPU support"
	default y
	help
	The FPU executes instructions from the processor's normal
	instruction stream. It can handle the types of high-precision
	floating-point processing operations commonly found in
	scientific, engineering, and business applications.  Enabling
	FPU support on a platform providing this hardware component
	may greatly improve performances.  You can obtain more
	information about Float-Point Unit on x86 platform on
	internet at the following URL:
	http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/techinfo/Pentium/fpu.htm

config RTAI_CPUS
	string "Number of CPUs (SMP-only)"
	default 2
	help
	RTAI has native support for Symmetrical Multi-Processing
	machines. If it is your case, you may want to enter here the
	number of CPUs of your motherboard.

	PAY ATTENTION: the default value is 2.

config RTAI_DIAG_TSC_SYNC
	bool "Diagnose out of sync MP-TSCs"
	default n
	help
	Check alignment of MP-TSCs, against a master CPU, and show them in
	the RTAI HAL proc file system (in TSC count units).

config RTAI_MASTER_TSC_CPU
	depends on RTAI_DIAG_TSC_SYNC
	string "Define the master CPU for aligning MP-TSCs"
	default 0
	help
	Master CPU for diagnosis and correction of TSCs alignment.

config RTAI_TUNE_TSC_SYNC
	depends on RTAI_DIAG_TSC_SYNC
	bool "Tune out of sync MP-TSCs"
	default n
	help
	Use offsets made available by enabling the out of sync diagnosis to
	keep readings of TSCs times as aligned as possible.

	help
	Allows choosing among:

	- Port based:    driver uses I/O ports, as defined by module vector 
                         parameters "io=port1,port2,...".

	- Memory mapped: driver uses memory mapping, as defined by module
			 vector parameters "mem=addr1,addr2,...".

	- Whatever:      the driver can use both I/O and memory mapping, as
			 assigned by "io" and "mem" module vectors parameters,
			 but with only one mode allowed for each device e.g.:
			 "io=0x2F8,0,0x3F8 mem=0,0xe0000000,0"; for devices 1,
			 2 and 3 respectively.
