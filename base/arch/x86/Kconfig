config RTAI_DONT_DISPATCH_CORE_IRQS
	bool "Direct vectoring of RTAI native interrupts"
	default y
	help

	RTAI dispatches real time interrupts immediately to achieve as
	low a overhead as possible. Very important on low end CPUs. By
	setting this option it is possible to achieve a further improvement
	by allowing hard RTAI internal timers and SMP interprocessor 
	scheduling interrupts to be vectored directly to their handlers, 
	i.e without any dispatching overhead. A must on low end CPUs.

config RTAI_FPU_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable FPU support"
	default y
	help
	The FPU executes instructions from the processor's normal
	instruction stream. It can handle the types of high-precision
	floating-point processing operations commonly found in
	scientific, engineering, and business applications.  Enabling
	FPU support on a platform providing this hardware component
	may greatly improve performances.  You can obtain more
	information about Float-Point Unit on x86 platform on
	internet at the following URL:
	http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/techinfo/Pentium/fpu.htm

config RTAI_CPUS

	default 2
	help
	RTAI has native support for Symmetrical Multi-Processing

	number of CPUs of your motherboard.

	PAY ATTENTION: the default value is 2.

config RTAI_DIAG_TSC_SYNC

config RTAI_SCHED_8254_LATENCY
	string "8254 tuning latency (ns)"
	default 4700
	help
	The anticipation time to be used to program the hard timer, in oneshot
	mode, for the next scheduling shot in order to compensate for the
	programming overhead needed to determine the right firing time.
	This parameter has no effect when the periodic mode is used.
	It should be determined with the calibration support provided by RTAI, 
	starting from a tentative configuration; better if set to zero
	for the very first calibration. 
	The same value is used as a compromise for both kernel and 
	user space tasks. Which means that for an on time user space task there 
	could be some anticipation, i.e. a negative latency, for a kernel space
	task. The busy alignment option should be used in such a case to
	provide a compromised on time scheduling for both, albeit at a 
	negligible added cost.

config RTAI_KERN_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY
	string "Delay to return to a switched in timed kernel task (ns)"
	default 0
	depends on RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	help
	The average time to return to the timed call function after switching 
	back to a kernel space task switch. 
	It is subtracted from the resume time of a timed task to avoid 
	a delayed return when a busy wait to align to the resume time is 
	requested.
	To calibrate it enable RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN and set this and the 
	following option to one, then run the calibration helper available 
	in RTAI.
	A zero value will skip the busy alignment, as if RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	was not set. Useful to allow the alignment application just to kernel 
	or user tasks. For example when a precise calibration for user space 
	is used, a kernel task will anticipate its timed resumption; so setting
	a positive value here and a zero for the corresponding option 
	below will allow applying the busy wait just to kernel tasks.

config RTAI_USER_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY
	string "Delay to return to a switched in timed user task (ns)"
	default 0
	depends on RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	help
	The average time to return to the timed call function after switching 
	back to a user space task switch. 
	It is subtracted from the resume time of a timed task to avoid 
	a delayed return when a busy wait to align to the resume time is
	requested.
	To calibrate it enable RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN and set this and the 
	previous option to one, then run the calibration helper available 
	in RTAI.
	A zero value will skip the busy alignment, as if RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN

        or user tasks.

	default m
	help
	This RTAI specific module allows sharing memory inter-intra
	real-time tasks and Linux processes. In fact it can be an
	alternative to the SYSTEM V shared memory. It may also be
	noticed that the services are symmetrical, i.e. the same calls
	can be used both in real-time tasks (within the kernel) and
	Linux processes.
	The module will be called rtai_shm.o.

	RTAI pre-allocates a global heap as part of its initialization

	kilobytes).

config RTAI_HARD_SOFT_TOGGLER
	bool "Install Linux signal handler to toggle hard-soft modes"
	default n
	help
	By setting this option RTAI will install a Linux signal (SIGUSR1) and 
	handler, when any of the available task-thread init functions is called
	to enable the usage of its own APIs. With it is possible to toggle the 
	hard-soft mode of any task, asynchronously and outside of it, by using 
	some form of KILL, i.e.: "kill -USR1 <pid>" from a shell, or 
	"kill(pid, SIGUSR1)" from a C function. For the latter case the helper 
	function "pid_t rt_get_linux_tid(RT_TASK *rt_task)" has been added to
	help in quickly getting the pid of the RTAI task extension "rt_task" 
	of a Linux task.
